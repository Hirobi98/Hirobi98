## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm HirobiChakma â€” a curious and motivated Computer Science student who's just getting started in the world of programming and data.

I'm currently learning Python and diving into the world of data analysis using tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I'm also exploring Kivy to build simple front-end apps, and I have a solid base in C, C++, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
I'm especially interested in data science, data analysis,and building things that solve real problems â€” even if theyâ€™re small. I pick up new skills quickly and enjoy turning ideas into projects, no matter how basic.
I'm just starting out,but Iâ€™m learning every day and excited to keep improving.
